This repository is for the extended research project I completed, titled "Challenges in the use of MCMC for heavily correlated parameters". 

This involved a ~7500 word academic paper on issues that can arise with MCMC, when the parameters we want to quantify are highly correlated with each other.
For this project, I had to research background theory on MCMC and the SIR model, an epidemiological model which provided the context for the project. Then, I
built MCMC algorithms from scratch, making variations in each, and compared their performances. This sparked discussion into which models performed best, 
and allowed me to give recommendations for those who may tackle similar problems in the future.

It also involved a 5 minute video, which was aimed at explaining the overall aims and findings of the project to a less technical audience.

I have also attached the Jupyter notebook, which gives all the code used to create the algorithms and produce all accompanying graphs/images.
